      <description>Killing Two Birds with One Paper My last fall semester exam was for Social Economics class. Reading through packets of model summaries, I set out to determine which model &amp;ndash; besides the obviously lovable Coate and Loury (1993) &amp;ndash; I would most like to understand, remember, and explain. That is, I picked a paper to write about here&amp;hellip; which I could also use in my intellectual battle with those pesky blue books.</description>

      <description>Intro Hello world, I am now a G2 in economics PhD-land. This means I have moved up in the academic hierarchy; I now reign over my very own cube, and I am taking classes in my fields of interest. For me that means: Social Economics, Behavioral Economics, and Market Design. That also means I am coming across a lot of models, concepts, results that I want to tell you (whoever you are!</description>

      <description>Cold Open A few years ago I came across a short paper that I desperately wanted to understand. The magnificent title was &amp;ldquo;An Option Value Problem from Seinfeld&amp;rdquo; and the author, Professor Avinash Dixit (of Dixit-Stiglitz model fame), therein discussed methods of solving for &amp;ldquo;sponge-worthiness.&amp;rdquo; I don&amp;rsquo;t think I need to explain why I was immediately drawn to an academic article that focuses on Elaine Benes, but for those of you who didn&amp;rsquo;t learn about the realities of birth control from this episode of 1990&amp;rsquo;s television, allow me to briefly explain the relevant Seinfeld-ism.</description>

      <description>An intro to the melted, gooey mind of a post-finals PhD student In the days preceding my game theory final, I was quarantined in my Cambridge apartment. The heat was on and pages of yellow legal paper decorated with inky matrices and tree diagrams ruled my kitchen counters. Swaddled in some convex combination of polar fleece and section notes, I would only leave my warm fortress to (1) throw $4 at an increasingly hard-to-please chai tea habit, and (2) play and train for my sport of choice&amp;ndash;that is, ultimate frisbee.</description>

      <description>On the morning of my dynamic programming midterm, I tried to calm myself by recalling the golden rules of grad school that have been passed down through the generations1:
 grades don&amp;rsquo;t matter&amp;hellip; nothing matters.
 However, I quickly realized that by adopting this perspective I was simply subbing out test anxiety for existential anxiety. And, come to think of it, the latter didn&amp;rsquo;t seem to be helpful, while the former could actually aid in my short-term goals &amp;ndash; namely, jotting down lots of equations into a collection of small blue booklets.</description>
