      <description>It has been exactly one week since the Senate voted to start debate on Obamacare. There were three Obamacare repeal proposals that followed in the wake of the original vote.

I then used that data to geographically illustrate Senators&amp;rsquo; votes for each Obamacare-related vote.</description>
