      <description>Cold Open A few years ago I came across a short paper that I desperately wanted to understand. The magnificent title was &amp;ldquo;An Option Value Problem from Seinfeld&amp;rdquo; and the author, Professor Avinash Dixit (of Dixit-Stiglitz model fame), therein discussed methods of solving for &amp;ldquo;sponge-worthiness.&amp;rdquo; I don&amp;rsquo;t think I need to explain why I was immediately drawn to an academic article that focuses on Elaine Benes, but for those of you who didn&amp;rsquo;t learn about the realities of birth control from this episode of 1990&amp;rsquo;s television, allow me to briefly explain the relevant Seinfeld-ism.</description>

 However, I quickly realized that by adopting this perspective I was simply subbing out test anxiety for existential anxiety. And, come to think of it, the latter didn&amp;rsquo;t seem to be helpful, while the former could actually aid in my short-term goals &amp;ndash; namely, jotting down lots of equations into a collection of small blue booklets.</description>
