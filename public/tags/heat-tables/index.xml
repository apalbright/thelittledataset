      <description>Intro The Oscars, like most award shows, are a mixture of the scripted and the unscripted. While the skeleton of the show rests upon the predetermined quips of the host and award presenters, the flesh of the Oscars rests within the surprise wins that are embodied by acceptance speeches given by excited, nervous, and often emotional award winners. Every year there are dozens of Oscar speeches and this year I began to wonder what one could glean from all that information abstractly balled up into little packages of &amp;ldquo;thank you&amp;rdquo;s and &amp;ldquo;wow&amp;rdquo;s and &amp;ldquo;I love you, mom&amp;rdquo;s that are spilled out onto the stage year after year.</description>
