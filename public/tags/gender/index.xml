      <description>Intro Hello world, I am now a G2 in economics PhD-land. This means I have moved up in the academic hierarchy; I now reign over my very own cube, and I am taking classes in my fields of interest. For me that means: Social Economics, Behavioral Economics, and Market Design. That also means I am coming across a lot of models, concepts, results that I want to tell you (whoever you are!</description>

      <description>An intro to the melted, gooey mind of a post-finals PhD student In the days preceding my game theory final, I was quarantined in my Cambridge apartment. The heat was on and pages of yellow legal paper decorated with inky matrices and tree diagrams ruled my kitchen counters. Swaddled in some convex combination of polar fleece and section notes, I would only leave my warm fortress to (1) throw $4 at an increasingly hard-to-please chai tea habit, and (2) play and train for my sport of choice&amp;ndash;that is, ultimate frisbee.</description>

      <description>Intro In the current educational landscape, there is a constant stream of calls to improve female representation in the sciences. However, the call to action is often framed within the aforementioned nebulous realm of “the sciences”—an umbrella term that ignores the distinct environments across the scientific disciplines. To better understand the true state of women in “the sciences,” we must investigate representation at the discipline level in the context of both undergraduate and doctoral education.</description>

      <description>Intro One day back in the early 2000&amp;rsquo;s, I commandeered one of my mom&amp;rsquo;s many spiral notebooks. I&amp;rsquo;d carry the notebook all around Manhattan, allowing it to accompany me everywhere from pizza parlors to playgrounds, while the notebook waited eagerly for my parents to hail a taxicab so it could fulfill its eventual purpose. Once in a cab, after clicking my seat belt into place (of course!), I&amp;rsquo;d pull out the notebook in order to develop one of my very first spreadsheets.</description>

      <description>Intro It&amp;rsquo;s that time of year&amp;hellip;the time of year when we are all reminded that the Swimsuit Issue of Sports Illustrated exists, a fact that made John Oliver&amp;rsquo;s team recently ask, &amp;ldquo;do people not understand they can now just type &amp;lsquo;naked ladies&amp;rsquo; into the internet and see what Google throws at them?&amp;rdquo; On top of being reminded of the Swimsuit Issue&amp;rsquo;s existence, I also recently became reminded of a question that has often popped into my head about Sports Illustrated: How many female athletes are on the cover of this magazine as compared to the number of swimsuit-clad models?</description>

      <title>I’d Like to Thank the Academy…</title>

      <description>Intro The Oscars, like most award shows, are a mixture of the scripted and the unscripted. While the skeleton of the show rests upon the predetermined quips of the host and award presenters, the flesh of the Oscars rests within the surprise wins that are embodied by acceptance speeches given by excited, nervous, and often emotional award winners. Every year there are dozens of Oscar speeches and this year I began to wonder what one could glean from all that information abstractly balled up into little packages of &amp;ldquo;thank you&amp;rdquo;s and &amp;ldquo;wow&amp;rdquo;s and &amp;ldquo;I love you, mom&amp;rdquo;s that are spilled out onto the stage year after year.</description>
