      <description>Disclaimer This post does not refer to actual friendships&amp;ndash;no, I am writing about Friends the television show and the corresponding fictional friendships born out of the 1990&amp;rsquo;s sitcom universe.
Intro Given Netflix&amp;rsquo;s much anticipated addition of Friends to their online streaming empire, it is no surprise that public attention has refocused on the show. On a whim that was more nostalgic than anything else, I started re-watching episodes in the &amp;ldquo;sweet spot&amp;rdquo; of its 10-season run (seasons 3 &amp;amp; 4, in my opinion).</description>
