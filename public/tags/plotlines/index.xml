      <description>Since finishing my first year of my PhD, I have been spending some quality time with my computer. Sure, the two of us had been together all throughout the academic year, but we weren&amp;rsquo;t doing much together besides pdf-viewing and type-setting.

On a whim that was more nostalgic than anything else, I started re-watching episodes in the &amp;ldquo;sweet spot&amp;rdquo; of its 10-season run (seasons 3 &amp;amp; 4, in my opinion).</description>
