      <description>Intro It&amp;rsquo;s that time of year&amp;hellip;the time of year when we are all reminded that the Swimsuit Issue of Sports Illustrated exists, a fact that made John Oliver&amp;rsquo;s team recently ask, &amp;ldquo;do people not understand they can now just type &amp;lsquo;naked ladies&amp;rsquo; into the internet and see what Google throws at them?&amp;rdquo; On top of being reminded of the Swimsuit Issue&amp;rsquo;s existence, I also recently became reminded of a question that has often popped into my head about Sports Illustrated: How many female athletes are on the cover of this magazine as compared to the number of swimsuit-clad models?</description>

      <description>Intro The Oscars, like most award shows, are a mixture of the scripted and the unscripted. While the skeleton of the show rests upon the predetermined quips of the host and award presenters, the flesh of the Oscars rests within the surprise wins that are embodied by acceptance speeches given by excited, nervous, and often emotional award winners. Every year there are dozens of Oscar speeches and this year I began to wonder what one could glean from all that information abstractly balled up into little packages of &amp;ldquo;thank you&amp;rdquo;s and &amp;ldquo;wow&amp;rdquo;s and &amp;ldquo;I love you, mom&amp;rdquo;s that are spilled out onto the stage year after year.</description>
