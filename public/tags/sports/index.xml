      <description>A Personal History of Podcast Listening One afternoon of my junior year, I listened to a chunk of a Radiolab episode about &amp;ldquo;Sleep&amp;rdquo; as I myself heavily sank into unconsciousness. It was like guided meditation&amp;hellip; supported, in part, by the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation. Jad and Robert&amp;rsquo;s forays on Radiolab quickly became my new bedtime stories. They helped me transition from days with my nose deep in books and, more accurately, my laptop to dreams that veered away from the geographic markers of one tiny college town in a valley of the Berkshires.</description>

      <description>Intro It&amp;rsquo;s that time of year&amp;hellip;the time of year when we are all reminded that the Swimsuit Issue of Sports Illustrated exists, a fact that made John Oliver&amp;rsquo;s team recently ask, &amp;ldquo;do people not understand they can now just type &amp;lsquo;naked ladies&amp;rsquo; into the internet and see what Google throws at them?&amp;rdquo; On top of being reminded of the Swimsuit Issue&amp;rsquo;s existence, I also recently became reminded of a question that has often popped into my head about Sports Illustrated: How many female athletes are on the cover of this magazine as compared to the number of swimsuit-clad models?</description>
