      <description>Meow-tivation1 In my day-to-day, I often work with data on ages and names. Age is an important covariate to include in regressions; its continuous evolution can also lend itself to clever regression discontinuity designs.2 Meanwhile, names can be used to infer often omitted demographic variables such as gender and race.3 I have seen these two variables collected for scores and scores of people&amp;hellip; but, what about when the sample isn&amp;rsquo;t people anymore?</description>

      <description>Intro One day back in the early 2000&amp;rsquo;s, I commandeered one of my mom&amp;rsquo;s many spiral notebooks. I&amp;rsquo;d carry the notebook all around Manhattan, allowing it to accompany me everywhere from pizza parlors to playgrounds, while the notebook waited eagerly for my parents to hail a taxicab so it could fulfill its eventual purpose. Once in a cab, after clicking my seat belt into place (of course!), I&amp;rsquo;d pull out the notebook in order to develop one of my very first spreadsheets.</description>
