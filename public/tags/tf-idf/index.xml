      <description>Meow-tivation1 In my day-to-day, I often work with data on ages and names. Age is an important covariate to include in regressions; its continuous evolution can also lend itself to clever regression discontinuity designs.2 Meanwhile, names can be used to infer often omitted demographic variables such as gender and race.3 I have seen these two variables collected for scores and scores of people&amp;hellip; but, what about when the sample isn&amp;rsquo;t people anymore?</description>

      <description>Newsletter e-mails are often artifacts of faded interests or ancient online shopping endeavors. They can be nostalgia-inducing &amp;ndash; virtual time capsules set in motion by your past self at $t-2$, and egged on by your past self at $t-1$. Remember that free comedy show, that desk lamp purchase (the one that looks Pixar-esque), that political campaign&amp;hellip; oof, actually let&amp;rsquo;s scratch that last one. But, without careful care, newsletters breed like rabbits and mercilessly crowd inboxes.</description>
