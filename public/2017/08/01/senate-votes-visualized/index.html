<p>It has been exactly one week since the Senate voted to start debate on Obamacare. There were three Obamacare repeal proposals that followed in the wake of the original vote. <strong>Each one failed, but in a different way.</strong> News outlets such as the <em>NYTimes</em> did a great job reporting how each Senator voted for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/07/25/us/politics/senate-vote-republican-health-care-bill.html">all</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/07/25/us/politics/senate-votes-repeal-obamacare.html">the proposals</a>. I then used that data to geographically illustrate Senators&rsquo; votes for each Obamacare-related vote. See below for a timeline of this past week&rsquo;s events and accompanying R-generated visuals.</p>

<p>The senate votes to begin debate.</p>

<p><img src="/post/senate-votes-visualized_files/deb_final.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>This passes 51-50 with Pence casting the tie-breaking vote. The visual shows the number of <code>(R)</code> and <code>(D)</code> Senators in each state as well as how those Senators voted. We can easily identify Collins and Murkowski, the two Republicans who voted <code>NO</code>, by the <font color="purple"><strong>purple</strong></font> halves of their states (Maine and Alaska, respectively). While Democrats vote as a bloc in this case and in the impending three proposal votes, it is the Republicans who switch between <code>NO</code> and <code>YES</code> over the course of the week of Obamacare votes. Look for the switches between <font color="red"><strong>red</strong></font> and <font color="purple"><strong>purple</strong></font>.</p>

<h1 id="later-that-day">Later that day&hellip;</h1>

<p>The Senate votes on the <strong>Better Care Reconciliation Act</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="/post/senate-votes-visualized_files/rr_final.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>It fails 43-57 at the mercy of Democrats, Collins, Murkowski, and a more conservative bloc of Republicans.</p>

<h1 id="wednesday-july-26th-2017">Wednesday, July 26th, 2017</h1>

<p>The Senate votes on the <strong>Obamacare Repeal and Reconciliation Act</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="/post/senate-votes-visualized_files/pr_final.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>It fails 45-55 at the mercy of Democrats, Collins, Murkowski, and a more moderate bloc of Republicans.</p>

<h1 id="friday-july-28th-2017">Friday, July 28th, 2017</h1>

<p>The Senate votes on the <strong>Health Care Freedom Act</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="/post/senate-votes-visualized_files/sk_final.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>It fails 49-51 thanks to Democrats, Collins, Murkowski, and McCain. To hear the gasp behind the slice of purple in AZ, watch the video below.</p>

<h1 id="code">Code</h1>

<p>This was a great exercise in using a few R packages for the first time. Namely, <code>geofacet</code> and <code>magick</code>. The <a href="https://hafen.github.io/geofacet/">former</a> is used for creating visuals for different geographical regions, and is how the visualization is structured to look like the U.S. The <a href="http://www.danielphadley.com/ggplot-logo/">latter</a> allows you to add images onto plots, and is how there&rsquo;s a little zipper face emoji over DC (as DC has no Senators).</p>

<p>In terms of replication, my R notebook for generating included visuals is <a href="http://rpubs.com/apalbright/senate-votes-visualized">here</a>. The github repo is <a href="https://github.com/apalbright/senate-votes-viz">here</a>.</p>
