<h1 id="motivation">Motivation</h1>

<p>I spent some time in February figuring out how to download my iMessage data.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:Want-to-download"><a href="#fn:Want-to-download">1</a></sup> The idea was that I could then use that data to make Jesse an R Notebook Valentine. And it worked!</p>

</figure>

<p>That Valentine was an investigation into word usage (via tf-idf) and emotional tinges in messages (via sentiment dictionaries). I treated all the messages as two aggregated blocks (one from Jesse, one from me) and was not concerned with the time dimension (when messages were sent). However, I&rsquo;ve regularly hypothesized to Jesse that I know exactly what a graph of our iMessages would look like over time.</p>

<p>Why&rsquo;s that? Well, Jesse and I are in a LDR, which means we are accustomed to going weeks without seeing each other. When you live with your SO, you come home to the same place. There isn&rsquo;t a ton of need to send messages about your day, as you&rsquo;ll see them soon and can update them later. When you live across the country, you share text update frequently since you might not catch up over phone/video for a few days. Pretty intuitive, right? So, my hypothesis was this: message frequency is <em>ridiculously</em> inversely correlated with being in the same city.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:I-e-together-mes"><a href="#fn:I-e-together-mes">2</a></sup></p>

<h1 id="visually-testing-my-hypothesis">Visually testing my hypothesis</h1>

<p>To test this I wanted to plot the number of daily messages between us over the recent year and then mark time periods whether we were in fact in the same place or not.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:It-could-also-be"><a href="#fn:It-could-also-be">3</a></sup> Turns out, <strong>yes, you can perfectly identify when we are in the same city by plotting our daily iMessage frequency!</strong></p>

<p><img src="/post/text-me-back-a-year-of-ldr-communication_files/ldr_year.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>I am very proud of this visual since it fits my hypothesis perfectly and is a succinct visual story about our virtual communication. Beyond the aesthetics, it also depicts an important part of my life that often is invisible to people. So, I am proud to own both the graph and the reality it depicts.</p>

<p>Relevant to recent concerns about data privacy, <a href="https://bmchorse.weebly.com/">Brianna McHorse</a> pointed out that this visual is also an example of how effectively and easily inferences can be made using personal data. I think that&rsquo;s an incredibly powerful point. Jesse and I obviously didn&rsquo;t intend to map out our visit schedule with our messaging. But, the picture of our time together/apart is loud and clear nonetheless.</p>

<p>On a final, humbled note, I am very thankful to live in a time and place where I have the technology to keep so significantly in touch with someone on the other side of the country despite our physical distance.</p>

<h1 id="technical-notes">Technical Notes</h1>

<p>If you&rsquo;d like to download your own iMessage data, it&rsquo;s very simple!<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:Though-it-did-ta"><a href="#fn:Though-it-did-ta">4</a></sup> Necessary steps are explained at the start of <a href="http://rpubs.com/apalbright/text-me-back">this</a> R notebook, which also includes all code necessary to make a similar plot.</p>

<p>Major props go to <a href="https://aaronparecki.com/">Aaron Parecki</a> for building the <a href="https://github.com/aaronpk/iMessage-Export">command machinery</a> used in the data extraction process.</p>

<li id="fn:I-e-together-mes">I.e., together, message number low; apart, message number high. <a class="footnote-return" href="#fnref:I-e-together-mes">↩</a></li>
<li id="fn:It-could-also-be">It could also be informative to plot daily totals of words (or maybe characters?) sent over iMessage since many messages are emojis, a few words, and reactions to other messages. Ah, to be a millennial. <a class="footnote-return" href="#fnref:It-could-also-be">↩</a></li>
<li id="fn:Though-it-did-ta">Though it did take me a while to figure out and piece together a full protocol back in February &ndash; thanks to Gulya and Bad Memes et al. for help. <a class="footnote-return" href="#fnref:Though-it-did-ta">↩</a></li>
