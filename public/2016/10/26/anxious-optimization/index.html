<p>On the morning of my dynamic programming midterm, I tried to calm myself by recalling the golden rules of grad school that have been passed down through the generations<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:Thank-you-to-the"><a href="#fn:Thank-you-to-the">1</a></sup>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>grades don&rsquo;t matter&hellip; nothing matters.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, I quickly realized that by adopting this perspective <strong>I was simply subbing out test anxiety for existential anxiety.</strong> And, come to think of it, the latter didn&rsquo;t seem to be helpful, while the former could actually aid in my short-term goals &ndash; namely, jotting down lots of equations into a collection of small blue booklets.</p>

<p>In considering the roles that angst can play in day-to-day life, <strong>I started to become curious about whether I could model optimal choices of anxiety using dynamic programming techniques.</strong> Allow me to channel my inner Ed Glaeser<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:Ed-Glaeser-is-ou"><a href="#fn:Ed-Glaeser-is-ou">2</a></sup> using David Laibson-esque framework<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:David-Laibson-is"><a href="#fn:David-Laibson-is">3</a></sup> and wax poetic on the specifics of something you could call (using very flexible terminology) an &ldquo;economic model.&rdquo;</p>

<h1 id="let-s-assume">Let&rsquo;s Assume&hellip;</h1>

<p>Assume that anxiety has some negative cost (say to my overarching mental health), however, its presence in my life also often gets me to achieve goals that I do genuinely want to achieve. Therefore, anxiety factors into my personal utility function in both positive and negative ways. In other words, it is not some force in my life that I want to erase entirely since it can lead to incredibly positive outcomes.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s say, for the sake of model simplicity and for the sake of accuracy since I&rsquo;m in academia now<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:I-kid-I-kid-I-m"><a href="#fn:I-kid-I-kid-I-m">4</a></sup>, that my utility function is simply equated to my academic success. Imagine that academic success is some definable and quantifiable concept&ndash;we could define this as some weighted average of number of papers published in quality journals, number of good relationships with faculty members, etc.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s also assume that this type of success that is a function of (and increasing in) two items: idea creation and execution of ideas. This seems reasonable to me. The next piece is where the real controversial and strict assumptions come in with respect to anxiety: I assume that idea creation is a function of (and increasing in) existential anxiety, while execution is a function of (and increasing in) time/test anxiety. Assume that the functions with respect to the anxiety types have positive first derivatives and negative second derivatives&ndash;this is equivalent to assuming concavity.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:Note-In-reality"><a href="#fn:Note-In-reality">5</a></sup></p>

<p>Then, given these assumptions and the framework of dynamic programming, the optimization problem of interest is equivalent to solving a maximization problem over the lifecycle.</p>

<p><img src="/post/anxious-optimization_files/max_prob.png" alt="" width="90%" height="90%"/></p>

<p>Explicitly solving this optimization problem requires more assumptions about functional forms and the like. (Ed, I&rsquo;m open to your ideas!) Sure, it&rsquo;d be much simpler to somehow make this a one variable maximization problem &ndash; a transformation we are often able to achieve by exploiting some budget constraint and Walras&rsquo; law &ndash; however, I do not believe that anxiety measures should add to some value beyond human choice. Other potential questions: Do we think our state variables follow an Ito process? I.e., I could see the existential anxiety variable following geometric Brownian motion since drift maybe should rise exponentially with time?</p>

<h1 id="back-to-reality">Back to Reality</h1>

<p>An implication of my model build that comes straight out of my assumptions (don&rsquo;t even need first order conditions for this) is that I should not be thinking about how &ldquo;nothing matters&rdquo; when there&rsquo;s an upcoming test. A test falls into the category of execution tasks, rather than the realm of idea creation. The existential anxiety that grows out of repeating the mantra &ldquo;nothing matters&rdquo; to myself over and over would only be helping come up with ideas&hellip; In fact, this whole model idea and post did come from continuing down the path of some existential thought process! So, perhaps the real question should be: is my blogging engrained in weighted average measure for &ldquo;academic success&rdquo;?</p>

<p>If so, I&rsquo;m feeling pretty optimized.</p>
