I am now no longer using Wordpress for my blog. I rebuilt my website using RStudio! R for blogging!\n\nI use RStudio and highly recommend the workflow.\n\nbuilt with blogdown and hugo\n\nstarted with wordpress... nah want my site in dropbox and saved... and version controlled\nwant the content more secure, also don't want y'all to be served ads\nalso also want to have footnotes and latex math and R code! can do all that cool stuff now!\n\nso i read the blogdown book last weekend (it was lit); picked a theme (xmin!) and then started to migrate all my content over. That meant copy and pasted and then reformatting things so now all written in markdown. Added bolds, italics, sections, code chunks, latex math, footnotes. i think everything looks much better now. \n\n# Steps in RStudio\n\ndownload blogdown, hugo...\nnew project\n\nblogdown::new_site(theme = \"yihui/hugo-xmin\")\n\nxmin theme blogdown\n\nwrite .md files in content folder. insert images from static folder. \nserve site to see previews\n\nnetlify  \n\nHugo version is 0.47.1\n\n# Deployment (Netlify)\n\nFree hosting!\nwhy? suggested by book\nalso, Netlify offers free HTTPS (which github pages doesn't)\n\n# Custom Domain\n\nhttps https://medium.com/@squiroid/migrated-my-website-to-https-in-5-min-via-netlify-7db1b2abf5ce\n\nown `thelittledataset.com` but got through wordpress so need to transfer to new [domain name registrars](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/registration.html). I decided to use.\n\nregistrar of domain vs host\ndon't want wordpress as host anymore (Netlify will be the host and it's free!)... could keep domain name with them and then host elsewhere... prob cheaper and easier to transfer it though?\n\n[instructions](https://en.support.wordpress.com/move-domain/transfer-domain-registration/)\n\nSet up custom domain for netlify\nhttps://www.netlify.com/docs/custom-domains/",
