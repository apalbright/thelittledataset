# Harvard Economics

- **Senior Thesis Seminar Leader, 2020-2021**
- **Senior Thesis Seminar Leader, 2018-2019**

In the Harvard Economics department, I was a seminar leader for undergraduate thesis writers [(Ec 985)](https://economics.harvard.edu/senior-thesis) in AY 2018-2019 (IRL) and AY 2020-2021 (on Zoom). In this role, I advised ~10 research projects each year by providing regular 1-1 meetings and facilitating opportunities for group discussion and feedback. 

- [Here are resources I share with undergrad thesis writers](/undergrad-thesis-resources/)
- [Here are student comments on my teaching](/student-comments/)
- Here are my *Certificates of Distinction in Teaching*: [Fall 2020](/./teaching_files/teaching-distinction-fall-2020.png) & [Spring 2021](/./teaching_files/teaching-distinction-spring-2021.png) 
- Instructor evaluation score means:
  - 4.86 out of 5 (AY 2020-2021) 
  - 4.90 out of 5 (AY 2018-2019)

Below are some theses I advised that are publicly available so you can read them too!
