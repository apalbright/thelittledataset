- Undergraduate Thesis Seminar Leader, 2018-2019

As an [Ec 985](https://economics.harvard.edu/senior-thesis) instructor, I advised ~10 research projects each year via 1-1 meetings & structured group discussions. 

- [Here](/undergrad-thesis-resources/) are resources I share with undergrad thesis writers
- [Here](/student-comments/) are student comments on my teaching

Here are theses written by my prior students that you can read online: [Shi (2021)](https://www.hks.harvard.edu/sites/default/files/centers/mrcbg/files/AWP_169_final.pdf) on geographic disparities in the paycheck protection program & [Swonder (2019)](https://dustinswonder.github.io/displacement_opioids_ds.pdf) on the effects of job displacement on opioid demand.
