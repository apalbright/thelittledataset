I'm **Alex Albright** and I'm an economist who enjoys asking questions and exploring answers with data. Like Florence Nightingale, *"whenever I am infuriated, I revenge myself with a new diagram."*

This blog, **The Little Dataset**, functions as an informal outlet for my curiosities and coding (mis)adventures. 

While academic journals have low paper acceptance rates, it turns out a blog you run yourself will publish 100% of your data visualizations and musings.

For information about my professional research and work, <br>please visit **[albrightalex.com](https://www.albrightalex.com/)** 

I always enjoy connecting with people about blog posts, data, pretty graphs, R coding, etc. Feel free to email me: alexalbright.tld@gmail.com or find me on Twitter [@allbriteallday](https://twitter.com/AllbriteAllday)
