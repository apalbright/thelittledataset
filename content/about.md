I'm **Alex Albright** and I'm an economist who enjoys asking questions and exploring answers with data. I aspire to live by Florence Nightingale's words, *"whenever I am infuriated, I revenge myself with a new diagram."*

This blog, **The Little Dataset That Could**, functions as an informal outlet for my curiosities and coding (mis)adventures. While academic journals have low paper acceptance rates, it turns out a blog you run yourself will publish 100% of your data visualizations and musings.

Looking for toy data or code snippets? I catalog all data and code used for my blog posts [here](https://thelittledataset.com/my-resources/).

I always enjoy connecting with people about random datasets, pretty graphs, R, etc. Feel free to get in touch via email (`alex@albrightalex.com`) or bluesky ([@allbriteallday](https://bsky.app/profile/allbriteallday.bsky.social)).

You can learn about my academic research projects on my professional website [here](https://www.albrightalex.com/).
