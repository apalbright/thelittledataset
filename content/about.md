title: About
---

I'm **Alex Albright** and I'm an economist who enjoys asking questions and exploring answers with data. Like Florence Nightingale, *"whenever I am infuriated, I revenge myself with a new diagram."*

This blog, **The Little Dataset**, functions as an informal outlet for my curiosities and coding (mis)adventures. While academic journals have low paper acceptance rates, it turns out a blog you run yourself will publish 100% of your data visualizations and musings.

Want some toy data or code? I catalog the data and code used for blog projects [here](https://thelittledataset.com/my-resources/).

I always enjoy connecting with people about random datasets, pretty graphs, R, etc. Feel free to get in touch via email (`alex@albrightalex.com`) or Twitter ([\@allbriteallday](https://twitter.com/AllbriteAllday)).

You can learn about my academic research at my professional website: [**albrightalex.com**](https://www.albrightalex.com/)
