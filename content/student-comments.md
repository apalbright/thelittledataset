title: Student comments on my teaching
---

Below I provide student comments on my teaching. These are anonymous comments and feedback from my formal Harvard FAS Course Evaluation Results.^[My personal favorite comment from a student (that was not via formal course evaluations) is pretty unrelated to my teaching -- it was after I participated in a lip sync celebration video for graduating Seniors: *"I've never been more excited for the future of the profession -- finally, a mentor who can sing AND dance at the same time!"*] 

## Senior Thesis Seminar Leader, Spring 2021:

> - "Simply the best section head I have had in four years at Harvard."
- "Alex Albright is genuinely one of the best educators I have ever had at Harvard. She is so intelligent, she gives incredible feedback,
and she is extremely supportive of students. If you have an opportunity to take her seminar DO IT. She met with me outside of class
and my thesis would've been soooo much worse without her."
- "Alex did a great job of helping me transition from consuming economic research to producing it myself. She facilitated discussions
during class to help us learn from our other thesising classmates, and her detailed feedback on our drafts was incredibly helpful."
- "Alex was a phenomenal instructor. She shared many helpful resources related to coding, organizing and compiling references, and
writing. She gave excellent comments on paper drafts, which always helped me to improve my draft. She facilitated a welcoming
and productive seminar environment where students were able to collaborate effectively. Alex was always willing to help answer a
question and/or point me in the direction of someone else who could discuss further. I couldn't ask for a better instructor!"
- "ALEX ALBRIGHT IS SPECTACULAR. I really appreciate the economics department in general for creating a strong structure for
thesis writers to complete their projects. In particular, Alex Albright is the reason that my thesis exists."
- "Alex is wonderful! She's super energetic and her comments are helpful!"

## Senior Thesis Seminar Leader, Fall 2020:

> - "Alex is literally a 12/10. Extremely organized, such a good presenter, cares so much about us, goes out of her way for us, gives us so many resources, gives incredible feedback so quickly. Alex is an incredible section leader and I can't wait for her to be a full fledged professor once she is Dr. Albright. :)"
- "Alex is incredible and you will be so, so happy if you take her 985 section. She's such a good facilitator, so organized, she gives great feedback really quickly, and she is really understanding. She's super smart and a great leader and she's gonna help you write an awesome thesis if you choose her seminar."
- "Alex is an ABSOLUTE GEM! She customizes each experience, which is so important. I admit I was not the most productive student this semester, yet she guided me at the perfect pace––pushed me when I needed to be pushed and revelled in the successes when due. She maintains a prodcutive and functional section while also creating an environment that fosters cooperation amongst students. I am so thankful I am in her section."
- "Alex is genuinely one of the most competent people I know. She is extremely organized, very intelligent, and she goes out of her way to help us out. I love the canvas site for this course, the way its so easy to find things. I love how many resources Alex gives us. and I love learning about other people's thesis presentations. There are truly not enough good things to say about this particular Ec985"
- "Alex is a great instructor! She is always available and accessible, and her comments are very helpful. It is also great to hear from and work with a group of students who are also working on a thesis!"
- "Alex goes out of her way to provide us with examples of everything we might need. Her slides are awesome as well."
- "Alex's feedback on my writing was thorough, detailed, and specific. She has really, really helped my thesis."
- "The instructor [Albright] was vivid and insightful in her commentary; this wasn't contained to deliverables, too. She continued the discussion in several ways, which helped add to the paper."


## Senior Thesis Seminar Leader, AY 2018-2019:
