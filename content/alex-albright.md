I am an economics PhD candidate at Harvard University (graduating in May 2022). I am also a Stone PhD Scholar in [Harvard's Inequality & Social Policy Program](https://inequality.hks.harvard.edu/) and a [Horowitz Foundation Grantee](https://www.horowitz-foundation.org/).

**NEW:** Starting in Fall 2022, I will be a Research Economist with the [Opportunity & Inclusive Growth Institute](https://www.minneapolisfed.org/institute) at the [Minneapolis Fed](https://www.minneapolisfed.org/).

My [research](https://thelittledataset.com/research/) is in labor economics, law and economics, and social policy. Recently I've studied bail reform policies, the use of predictive tools in the justice system, and the long-run effects of racial violence. 

My work has been featured in outlets such as The New York Times, The New Yorker, and WIRED. You can find my CV [here](https://thelittledataset.com/about_files/alex_albright_harvard_cv.pdf).

**Blog/resources:** I explore a wide range of questions with data and economics at my blog [here](https://thelittledataset.com/). I share data and code for those projects [here](https://thelittledataset.com/my-resources/) and curate lists of other resources for R coding/empirical economics [here](https://thelittledataset.com/other-resources/).
