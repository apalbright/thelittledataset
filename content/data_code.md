title: Resources
---

As a self-taught R user, I am deeply indebted to the R community for making code samples and interesting datasets publicly available. In order to pay it forward, I use this page to [**(1)**](#p1) provide the data/code behind my content.^[*Please don't judge 2015-me too much.*] and [**(2)**](#p2) list some incredible resources (for data science, R, and economics) that I frequently use. 

**I hope all the below helps you to build/write/create stuff!** Remember that with coding, practice makes perf... better.

# <a name="p1"></a> (1) Resources from me to you

## Projects on my blog

In general, my project materials are available as [github repos](https://github.com/apalbright?tab=repositories). I also publish R notebooks as [RPubs](https://rpubs.com/apalbright). I link to relevant repos/notebooks at the bottom of all blog posts.

*(While my Github repos will include the `.Rmd` files for R notebooks, I also share notebooks as published through RPubs since they are easier to read in that format. Example: [here](https://github.com/apalbright/ct_pretrial1/blob/master/ct_pretrial.Rmd) is a `Rmd` file on Github, [here](http://rpubs.com/apalbright/ct-pretrial) is the same notebook on RPubs.)*
