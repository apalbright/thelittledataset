As a self-taught R user, I am deeply indebted to the R community for making code samples and interesting datasets publicly available. In order to pay it forward, I provide [**(I) the data/code behind my content**](/my-resources/)^[*Please don't judge 2015-me too much.*] and [**(II) curated lists of resources (for R/data science/economics)**](/other-resources/) that I frequently use and/or seriously admire.

# (I) [Resources from me to you](/my-resources/)

*(Includes: code/data for my blog projects, websites, CV)*

# (II) [Resources from others to you](/other-resources/)

*(Includes: R resources, empirical econ resources, data viz inspo, etc.)*

## I hope all the above help you to build/write/create stuff! 
### Remember that with coding, practice makes perf... better.
