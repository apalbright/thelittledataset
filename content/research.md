### No Money Bail, No Problems? Evidence from an Automatic Release Program

> <details>

  *Are the effects of money bail on misconduct large enough to justify its costs? Money bail advocates argue that its usage is critical for averting misconduct, while skeptics counter that its effects are small and not worth the consequent human costs of pretrial detention. I address this debate directly by using administrative data and a policy reform in Kentucky. An automatic release program removed financial bail conditions for a subset of low-level cases, creating an opportunity to estimate the program's effects on detention and misconduct using a differences-in-differences approach. The program cut the usage of financial bail by 50.5 p.p., while it increased the rate of failure to appear by 3.3 p.p. The program’s effect on pretrial rearrest is indistinguishable from zero, and the data rules out even modest sized increases. Effects on misconduct are primarily driven by substitution away from money bail, rather than from unsecured bail (which only requires payment in the event of misconduct). This finding suggests that threats of future fines (forfeiting unsecured bail) may not be effective deterrents of misconduct. The program reduced hours in detention despite modest money bail requirements ($360 on average) in its absence, which implies financial difficulty with posting small sums delays release. Consistent with this interpretation, effects on release are larger in lower-income zip codes and among unemployed defendants. One instance of misconduct needs to be at least 18 times as costly as one day in detention for money bail to justify its costs in this policy environment.*

### [If You Give a Judge a Risk Score: Evidence from Kentucky Bail Decisions](https://thelittledataset.com/about_files/albright_judge_score.pdf)

> <details>
  <summary>Click for abstract</summary>
  *Prediction tools, such as risk scores, often serve as decision aids rather than entirely overriding human discretion. How does the implementation of risk scores impact human decisions? I study a policy change that recommended no money bail for defendants below a set risk threshold. The policy decreased the money bail rate for defendants with risk scores slightly lower than the risk threshold but did not change rates for defendants with scores slightly higher than the threshold. As such, the policy changed the overall rate of money bail rather than simply shifting its allocation across cases. I argue this is consistent with a model where prediction-based recommendations shift the costs of mistakes from individual decision-makers (judges) to the social planners who set recommendations. Black defendants benefit less than white defendants with identical risk scores from the no money bail recommendation. Disparate benefits by race are driven by variation in behavior between (rather than within) judges – judges who see more white defendants are more likely to comply with the no money bail recommendation. The relationship between defendant population and judicial behavior is not explained by judge covariates. Results are consistent with a model where recommendations decrease the costs of mistakes more in racially homogeneous populations.*

### [After The Burning: The Economic Effects of the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre](https://www.nber.org/papers/w28985) *(with Jeremy Cook, James Feigenbaum, Laura Kincaide, Jason Long, and Nathan Nunn)*

  *The 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre resulted in the looting, burning, and leveling of 35 square blocks of a once-thriving Black neighborhood. Not only did this lead to severe economic loss, but the massacre also sent a warning to Black individuals across the country that similar events were possible in their communities. We examine the economic consequences of the massacre for Black populations in Tulsa and across the United States. We find that for the Black population of Tulsa, in the two decades that followed, the massacre led to declines in home ownership and occupational status. Outside of Tulsa, we find that the massacre also reduced home ownership. These effects were strongest in communities that were more exposed to newspaper coverage of the massacre or communities that, like Tulsa, had high levels of racial segregation. Examining effects after 1940, we find that the direct negative effects of the massacre on the home ownership of Black Tulsans, as well as the spillover effects working through newspaper coverage, persist and actually widen in the second half of the 20th Century.*

### Does Bias Training Change Bail Decisions?

> <details>
  <summary>Click for Abstract</summary>
  *Bias training programs are a popular low-cost approach to addressing racial disparities in the labor market as well as the criminal justice system. Despite their growing prevalence, the magnitude and permanence of their effects on high-stakes decision-making are uncertain. I investigate the effects of a brief bias training program on racial gaps in bail outcomes. The training was provided to a subset of judges who set bail but not others. Leveraging differential treatment over judges as well as time variation, I provide estimates of the training effect using difference-in-difference and triple differences approaches. In the month immediately following training, racial gaps in bail decisions decreased. However, the initial effects dissipated in the second and third months after training, suggesting the effects of brief training on judicial decision-making are unlikely to last in the long run.*
