# If You Give a Judge a Risk Score: Evidence from Kentucky Bail Decisions
### Alex Albright, Harvard University
### Eighth ECINEQ Meeting 2019
### July 3, 2019

# Predictive Scores and High-Stakes Decisions

--

Should we (loan officers) give you a loan?

## `\(\rightarrow\)` FICO scores

--

Should we (managers) hire you? 

## `\(\rightarrow\)` job testing

--

How should we (pretrial judges) set your bond?

## `\(\rightarrow\)` risk assessment scores
  
---

# Criminal Justice and Scores

--

### Scores used in bail, pretrial, or sentencing hearings in 49 of the 50 US states (Traughber 2018)

- Think of score as a "check-list" instrument *("Add 1 point if person has a prior felony conviction")*
  - Variation over states and counties in what goes into them
- SB10 in CA to get rid of money bail and move to risk score system
     
--

### Ongoing debate about implications of risk scores for racial justice

- ACLU opposed SB10 due to concerns about implementation's consequences on communities of color
- Eric Holder: score usage "may exacerbate unwarranted and unjust disparities"
- Michelle Alexander on "e-carceration": "The *Newest* Jim Crow"

---

# Automation vs. Discretion

--

### 1. With automation, mechanically, people with same risk scores get the same treatment

--

### 2. In practice, human discretion in how to use the scores

Kentucky Judge (51st Judicial District):

&gt; Judges are people. When I have to defer to this mathematical model that I don't really understand all that well... it's hard. I'm going to do the best I can with what they've given me.

---

# Research Questions

--

## How does requiring judges to use risk scores impact racial disparities? 

## What about for defendants with the same scores?

--

## `\(\rightarrow\)` Do judges follow risk score recommendations similarly across racial groups?

---

# This Project

## Policy change (June 2011) in Kentucky pretrial environment: **House Bill 463** 


--

1. Required judges to consider risk scores *(that were already in existence and optional)* in initial bond decisions

--

2. Made default for low/moderate defendants non-financial bond *(judges can deviate but must give reason)*

--

### Qs: How does requiring judges to use risk scores impact racial disparities? (Building on Stevenson, 2017) 

### What about for defendants with the same scores? Do judges follow risk score policy recommendations similarly across racial groups?

# Roadmap

## 1. Related Literature

## 2. Kentucky Pretrial System (Before and After HB463)

## 3. Data and Figures

## 4. Empirics and Results

## 5. Mechanisms &amp; Future Directions

---

# Literature

### Discussion of risk score generation

- Angwin and Kirchner (2016), Kleinberg et al. (2017), Corbett-Davies et al. (2017), Yang and Dobbie (2019), Kleinberg et al. (2018)

### Evidence that human decisions makers deviate from score recommendations

- Garrett and Monahan (2017), DeMichele et al. (2018), Hoffman, Kahn, and Li (2017), Main (2016),  Skeem, Scurich, and Monahan (2019), Green and Chen (2019)

### Risk score policy investigations

- Stevenson (2017), Sloan et al. (2018), Stevenson and Doleac (2019)

---

# Kentucky Pretrial System (2009-2013)

--

## `\(\rightarrow\)` Imagine you're arrested and booked into jail by the police 
--

## `\(\rightarrow\)` A judge makes an initial bond decision within 24 hours

--

## `\(\rightarrow\)` There are 3 steps to this

---

# 1. Pretrial Officer Collects Information

Pretrial officer (Pretrial Services employee) collects data on your arrest and charges 

  - police officer has full authority to charge; no prosecutorial review before bail decision
  - looks up/physically collects data on defendant criminal history/offense 
  - interviews defendant

--

### With all this data, they also calculate a **Kentucky Pretrial Risk Assessment level** 
---

# Kentucky Pretrial Risk Assessment (KPRA)

A checklist-style instrument:

- No verified local address: +2
- No verified means of support: +1
- A/B/C felony: +1
- New charge with pending case: +7
- FTA warrant or FTA misdemeanor or felony? +2
- Prior traffic FTA? +1
- Prior misdemeanor convictions? +2
- Prior felony convictions? +1
- Prior violent crime convictions? +1
- Drug/alcohol abuse? + 2
- Conviction for felony escape? +3
- On probation/parole from felony conviction? +1

## Low = 0-5; Moderate = 6-13; High = 14-max

# Enter HB463

### HB463 Background:

- Between "2000 and 2010, Kentucky’s incarcerated population – both jail and prison – grew by 45%, more than three times the U.S. average." (Stevenson, 2017)
- HB463 passed in response to budget concerns (effective date 6/8/11)
    - Goal was to decrease pretrial detention

--

### After HB463, again, 

- Within 24 hours, pretrial officer collects data and makes a presentation to the judge
- Judges has a few minutes to make initial bond decision

--

### But now...

---

# Data

## Data on 383,080 initial bond decisions for male defendants between 7/1/09-6/30/13

- Data via Kentucky Administrative Office of the Courts 
- KPRA time period (changed to different scoring system 7/1/13) 
- Spans 192,758 distinct defendants, 563 distinct judges 
- 79.1% white, 20.6% black 
- limiting to misdemeanors and felonies; 79.5% top charges are misdemeanors 
- 68.3% financial, 27.8% non-financial bond, 3.9% no bond

--

*Side note: Since being accepted to this conference, my understanding is that this sort of analysis of judge data has become illegal in France. (Article 33 of the Justice Reform Act)*

# Non-Financial Decisions Before/After HB463

# Does this look the same across rac...? No.

---

class: inverse, center, middle

# Is the jump in racial disparities in non-financial bond a consequence of different risk levels? 

# Or is deviation from the presumptive default more likely for black defendants?

---

# Risk level distributions look different by race

&lt;img src="../graphs/riskdensity.png" width="90%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

# But risk levels don't explain the gaps 

&lt;img src="../graphs/mot_risk.png" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

class: inverse, center, middle

## The presumptive default (of non-financial bond for low and moderate risk defendants) is *more likely to be overridden for black defendants than white defendants*

---

# What drives these differences in deviations across racial groups?

--

### 1. different underlying charges or defendant characteristics (different judge information sets)

--

### 2. different policy responses across judges

--

### 3. different treatment of similar defendants within judge and time

---

# Why are there disparities in deviations?

Empirical specifications to estimate (for each risk level):

(i) Raw:

`$$b_{it}= \alpha + \phi_1HB463_t + \phi_2 Black_i + \phi_3 (Black_i \times HB463_t) + \epsilon_{it}$$`

(ii) With judge information set:

`$$b_{ijct}= \alpha + \phi_1HB463_t + \phi_2 Black_i + \phi_3 (Black_i \times HB463_t) + \beta_1 \kappa_c + \beta_2 \delta_i + \omega_{t} + x_t + \epsilon_{ijct}$$`
(iii) With judge information set and time-varying judge FEs:

`$$b_{ijct}= \alpha + \phi_1HB463_t + \phi_2 Black_i + \phi_3 (Black_i \times HB463_t) + \beta_1 \kappa_c + \beta_2 \delta_i + \omega_{jt} + \epsilon_{ijct}$$`

- `\(b\)`: dummy variable for non-financial bond
- `\(\kappa_c\)`: vector of charge variables (severity, characteristics of offense)
- `\(\delta_i\)`: vector of defendant variables (characteristics, criminal history variables)
- `\(\omega_{j}\)`: judge FEs; `\(x_t\)`: time FEs
- `\(\omega_{jt}\)`: time-varying (month-year) judge FEs
- `\(\phi_3\)`: **coefficient of interest**

---

## Why might judge responses be important? *(spoiler)*

&lt;img src="../graphs/frac_counties.png" width="65%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

## Results 

&lt;img src="../graphs/coefs.png" width="85%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

- judge info sets don't meaningfully explain the changes in gaps
- low risk disparity changes mostly explained by judge-time FEs 
- moderate risk disparity changes remain after inclusion of judge-time FEs


---

class: inverse, center, middle

## (i) judges varied in their policy responsiveness; judges in whiter counties responded more to the new default than judges in blacker counties

## (ii) suggestive evidence that interaction with the same predictive score may lead to different predictions by race (within judge)

---

## Judicial Responsiveness Correlates with Population

&lt;img src="../graphs/judge_decisions_pre_post.png" width="90%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

## Future work: *why* this relationship?

--

Note: judges aren't randomly assigned to counties -- run for election in various counties

Two hypotheses:

--

### (1) judicial experience 

*larger counties in KY are higher % black, might be more prestigious to work there, more experienced judges get those roles, experience means you respond less to policy suggestions*   

--

### (2) pretrial misconduct rates 

*judges who have made decisions with higher pretrial misconduct rates are less likely to respond strongly (more saturated), if misconduct rates are higher for judges with higher % black defendants, this could be a response to that*

---

# Moderate Risk Result

### Result: within judge-time, racial disparity for moderate risk defendants after HB463 (but not before)

--

### Possible explanation: judge interaction with the same predictive score level can lead to different predictions by race

- empirical evidence related to Kleinberg and Mullainathan (2019) theoretical result
  - simplified prediction functions (e.g., risk assessments) create incentives for decision-makers to consider group membership information
- accords with Green and Chen (2019) and Skeem, Scurich, and Monahan (2019)
- relevant to hiring, loan decisions, and other important high-stakes decisions

---

# Conclusion

Results highlight the potential for:

--

## (i) hetereogeneous judicial policy responses (correlated with geography) to generate exacerbated racial disparities in aggregate

--

## (ii) risk score policies to generate disparate impacts even conditional on the scores themselves
